# StackStarter: Milestone-based Crowdfunding Platform

- Voting rights are granted to addresses that have contributed funds
- Multiple votes required to validate each milestone
- Transparent voting process recorded on-chain

### Secure Fund Management

- Automatic refund mechanism if funding goals aren't met
- Milestone-specific fund allocation
- Protection against unauthorized withdrawals
